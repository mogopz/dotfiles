## Manual installs
There's a few tools that aren't available in Homebrew so they need to be manually installed:
* [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
  * [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  * [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
* [Starship](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation)
* [SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim)
* [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

## App Store
These apps can be installed via the App Store or using [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas).

```console
# Amphetamine, Meeter, Things and Twitter
âžœ mas install 937984704 1510445899 904280696 1482454543
